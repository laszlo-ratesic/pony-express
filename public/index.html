                A team of private security contractors is recruited to
                Afghanistan, working high-risk contracts for SOC (Special
                Operations Consulting). As SOC expands their operations into the
                region, their assignments are wrought with less-than-optimal
                conditions and inadequate supplies as they try to gain a
                foothold in the surging market for private military contracts.

                from the public and examining the psychological impact on these

                       This book brings a world
                       to the doorstep of every reader who has never begun to
                       imagine the risks that so many of them make in order to
                       take care of our military personnel serving in combat zones.
                       The story goes beyond capturing the history surrounding this
                       rare segment of Americans and third country nationals who
                       sign up and put their lives on the line – it shares an
                       equally important look into the cultural nuances that it
                       takes to survive in the Middle East. This stark reminder is
                       important for readers to learn from the perspective of those
                       willing to risk their lives to deliver the mail – something
                       that most of us take for granted when they see the US Postal

                      As a commissioned officer and soldier with previous
                      deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, the “Postcards Through
                      Hell” took me back to my own experiences and I was immediately
                      able to identify with the mission objective. These men, many
                      prior military, opted to work in one of the most dangerous
                      professions worldwide and without the protection of the
                      military at their back. As professional security contractors
                      Edward Ford and Alan Chiasson present a clear and thrilling
                      picture of what some might believe a mundane job, driving
                      supply routes.

                        The reality is far from it, these men employed tactics,
                        techniques, and procedures honed from years of collective
                        experience in the theater of war to survive in a hostile
                        environment. Despite my many years of service, I learned
                        much and developed a greater appreciation for security
                        contractors. This book is “a must read” for all who are
                        considering working in the private sector as a security
                        contractor. As with combat missions, the men of the Pony
                        Express lost brothers, and this work serves to honor and
                        preserve their memory. It was a privilege to read, I
                        salute you all!

                      "The following is my endorsement for the upcoming book,
                      “Postcards Through Hell,” authored by Alan Chiasson and
                      Edward Ford. During my tenure at Camp Phoenix, I was
                      fortunate enough to have family that supported me greatly
                      in my mission there. I was constantly receiving packages
                      and mail from home; plus, packages I had ordered for
                      equipment that I needed to perform my duties. The Pony
                      Express, as they were known, were responsible for making
                      sure that our packages and mail always got delivered to
                      Camp Phoenix on time. I don't think they ever failed
                      their mission, despite the tremendous adversity and danger
                      they faced on a daily basis.

                        Their exploits moving through extremely hostile zones on
                        the road are the stuff legends are made of. I do not say
                        that lightly, having spent almost 10 years working
                         security in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I speak fondly
                         of these men and their team to this day. There is nothing
                         that lifts moral more in a combat zone than receiving
                         mail and care packages from home. Without it, life there
                         would be completely miserable. So my team and I were always
                         excited when we saw their big gray gun trucks pull in
                         through the gate. We knew what they faced to bring us a bit
                         of happiness from home. Without a doubt, this book would
                         be very well received by the military community, the loved
                         ones of all of those people who sent mail and the general
                         public at large. It would give them a glimpse inside the
                         world of these men, and what happened when they sent a
                         "Postcard Through Hell."

                       Modern warfare today has seen an influx of dedicated

                       is not done by simply stepping out the military and hanging
                       up the uniform. “Postcards Through Hell” highlights this
                       transition from uniform to an even greater cause of
                       friendship, brotherhood and courage, spanning a community

                      carries many of the same dangers as serving in frontline
                      combat units. In becoming aware of this project, I was
                      educated as to many things with which I was not familiar,

                      patriotic Americans. These men who served on active duty

                      real connection to home, the US Mail. I highly recommend this book to anyone
                      interested in learning about their heroic acts despite overwhelming odds against
                      the Taliban and other criminal insurgents. They are all heroes in my eyes and I
                      truly thank them for a job well done.

                      "Postcards Through Hell" is an engaging and gripping
                      account of a world many of us have heard about but know
                      little of. That of the Security Contractor. It opens the
                      door in a factual, honest and “boots on the ground”
                      detailed manner that allows the reader to feel as if they

                      As a journalist embedded during Operation Desert Storm,
                      I have unfortunately seen firsthand, the remnants of War.
                      War is not something easily explained to the average person.
                      To literally have your life in the hands of the person next
                      to you is not something most people will never comprehend,
                      but that trust is expected in battle and freely given. It is
                      that brotherhood and commitment that draws the warrior to
                      battle. “Postcards Through Hell” details a group of warriors
                      who share that same kind of brotherhood. They shed their
                      countries uniforms and donned the tactical garb of the private
                      security contractor, yet they still put their lives on the line
                      for the American Military every day.
                      <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails-4">I have personally volunteered
                      for organizations that put together care packages for Soldiers
                      Sailors, Airmen and Marines and have heard time and time again
                      how much those packages mean to the men and women receiving
                      them. The men of the Pony Express delivered those packages.
                      Forget snow, rain, sleet or hail, try bullets, roadside bombs,
                      RPG’s and the Taliban keeping you from your appointed rounds.
                      The Pony Express drove the most dangerous road in the world,
                      and sometimes off road, to deliver the mail! “Postcards Through
                      Hell” is their account of that brotherhood, the danger, and the
                      commitment it took to come through for American and coalition
                      forces. As private contractors they often faced an uphill battle,
                      but as Brothers they always got the job done. Thank you Gentlemen
                      for sharing your thrilling, dangerous, and deadly accounts of
                      what it took to drive on Ring Road, and Thank you most of
                      all for your Service and your Sacrifice.

                      It’s difficult to have a true appreciation for
                      the sacrifices of those who valiantly serve
                      in our Armed Forces or in the world of private
                      security contracting. I think it’s fair to say
                      that, when we hear the word “sacrifice”, we
                      immediately think of the ultimate one: the giving
                      up of one’s own life for the preservation of
                      another’s. The enormity of such selflessness
                      can never be overstated and those who have the
                      courage to offer their lives for that possible
                      outcome must always be honored. That said, there
                      are smaller sacrifices that these brave soldiers
                      make in the day to day grind of war. There are
                      mental and emotional sacrifices that only come
                      from constant near-death experiences, sacrifices
                      that are perhaps “small” relative to the
                      aforementioned ultimate one, but relentlessly pile
                      up nonetheless. This is what the book “Postcards
                      Through Hell” perfectly encapsulates.
                      <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails-5">The toils
                      of the human heart and mind in the midst of combat
                      are delivered by the authors with a precision and
                      utility that one would expect from meticulously
                      disciplined warriors such as themselves. Their
                      authentic human experiences as contractors in the
                      Middle East - one of the most dangerous regions
                      on Earth - provides invaluable historical context
                      to an era that we still find ourselves living in.

                      the sense of purpose and camaraderie seduced these
