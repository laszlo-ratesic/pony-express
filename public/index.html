                A team of private security contractors is recruited to
                Afghanistan, working high-risk contracts for SOC (Special
                Operations Consulting). As SOC expands their operations into the
                region, their assignments are wrought with less-than-optimal
                conditions and inadequate supplies as they try to gain a
                foothold in the surging market for private military contracts.

                      "As a leader of Marines and a combat veteran, this book
                      provides all of the information one would expect from
                      combat veterans. In combat, as in military life in
                      general, there are always unforgettable moments that stay
                      with us. Many are funny and nostalgic, while others are
                      tragic, provoking long moments of thought as we lose
                      comrades, bringing home the realization that we worked in
                      a very dangerous occupation.Ed Ford and Alan Chiasson
                      provide all of these examples in this extremely
                      informative and readable project.
                      <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails-1">People will learn
                      interesting things about the world of contracting, which
                      carries many of the same dangers as serving in frontline
                      combat units. In becoming aware of this project, I was
                      educated as to many things with which I was not familiar,
                      yet also the memory was triggered by many things that I
                      also experienced. The reader will enjoy the operational
                      details and methods, while also learning about a world
                      that is not well known outside the operators themselves. I
                      would suggest that people considering military service in
                      general, and military support contracting in particular
                      read this book. Being well informed prior to making such
                      life altering decisions is not just wise, it is expected
                      of the true professional. Many of us may leave the service
                      and take off the uniform, but we never stop being
                      patriotic Americans. These men who served on active duty
                      then decided to serve our nation further did so at great
                      risk. We can be proud of their service and their
                      dedication. God bless them all"

                      for the Pony Express. The book “Postcards Through Hell” is a fascinating
                      true tale of some of the bravest men to deliver the US Mail in war-torn
                      Afghanistan. This book suits either the historian or the non-fiction reader.
                      It is a riveting account of the SOC Mobile Operations teams who were
                      contracted to support the military by delivering US Mail and other critical
                      supplies throughout Afghanistan.

                      in the world. The men of the Pony Express are true patriots who risked life
                      and limb to provide our military and other contracted companies their only
                      real connection to home, the US Mail. I highly recommend this book to anyone
                      interested in learning about their heroic acts despite overwhelming odds against
                      the Taliban and other criminal insurgents. They are all heroes in my eyes and I
                      truly thank them for a job well done.

                      "Postcards Through Hell" is an engaging and gripping
                      account of a world many of us have heard about but know
                      little of. That of the Security Contractor. It opens the
                      door in a factual, honest and “boots on the ground”
                      detailed manner that allows the reader to feel as if they

                      As a journalist embedded during Operation Desert Storm,
                      I have unfortunately seen firsthand, the remnants of War.
                      War is not something easily explained to the average person.
                      To literally have your life in the hands of the person next
                      to you is not something most people will never comprehend,
                      but that trust is expected in battle and freely given. It is
                      that brotherhood and commitment that draws the warrior to
                      battle. “Postcards Through Hell” details a group of warriors
                      who share that same kind of brotherhood. They shed their
                      countries uniforms and donned the tactical garb of the private
                      security contractor, yet they still put their lives on the line
                      for the American Military every day.
                      <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails-4">I have personally volunteered
                      for organizations that put together care packages for Soldiers
                      Sailors, Airmen and Marines and have heard time and time again
                      how much those packages mean to the men and women receiving
                      them. The men of the Pony Express delivered those packages.
                      Forget snow, rain, sleet or hail, try bullets, roadside bombs,
                      RPG’s and the Taliban keeping you from your appointed rounds.
                      The Pony Express drove the most dangerous road in the world,
                      and sometimes off road, to deliver the mail! “Postcards Through
                      Hell” is their account of that brotherhood, the danger, and the
                      commitment it took to come through for American and coalition
                      forces. As private contractors they often faced an uphill battle,
                      but as Brothers they always got the job done. Thank you Gentlemen
                      for sharing your thrilling, dangerous, and deadly accounts of
                      what it took to drive on Ring Road, and Thank you most of
                      all for your Service and your Sacrifice.

                      It’s difficult to have a true appreciation for
                      the sacrifices of those who valiantly serve
                      in our Armed Forces or in the world of private
                      security contracting. I think it’s fair to say
                      that, when we hear the word “sacrifice”, we
                      immediately think of the ultimate one: the giving
                      up of one’s own life for the preservation of
                      another’s. The enormity of such selflessness
                      can never be overstated and those who have the
                      courage to offer their lives for that possible
                      outcome must always be honored. That said, there
                      are smaller sacrifices that these brave soldiers
                      make in the day to day grind of war. There are
                      mental and emotional sacrifices that only come
                      from constant near-death experiences, sacrifices
                      that are perhaps “small” relative to the
                      aforementioned ultimate one, but relentlessly pile
                      up nonetheless. This is what the book “Postcards
                      Through Hell” perfectly encapsulates.
                      <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails-5">The toils
                      of the human heart and mind in the midst of combat
                      are delivered by the authors with a precision and
                      utility that one would expect from meticulously
                      disciplined warriors such as themselves. Their
                      authentic human experiences as contractors in the
                      Middle East - one of the most dangerous regions
                      on Earth - provides invaluable historical context
                      to an era that we still find ourselves living in.

                      "Postcards Through Hell” is a fascinating account of
                      the daily dangers and challenges that forged deep

                      Despite the intense trials of life in Afghanistan,
                      the sense of purpose and camaraderie seduced these
                      men far from their homes, families, and comforts.
                      Within this memoir, there are great lessons to be learned
                      about finding meaning and fulfillment in life.
